# 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to **Echelon: Initiate Protocol** — this guide explains how to collaborate effectively while maintaining quality and consistency.

---

## 🔧 Development Standards
- Use **feature branches**: `feature/<short-description>`
- Follow **conventional commit messages**:
  - `feat:` new feature  
  - `fix:` bug fix  
  - `docs:` documentation change  
  - `chore:` tooling or maintenance

Example:
feat(ui): add parallax animation to landing page


---

## 🧱 Branch Workflow

1. Create your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-update


Make and test your changes locally.

Commit your work:

git add .
git commit -m "feat(core): describe update"


Push your branch:

git push origin feature/my-update


Submit a Pull Request (PR) into main.

✅ Code Quality

Run npm run lint before submitting a PR.

Use consistent indentation and spacing.

Keep commits small and descriptive.
